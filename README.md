# Global-Hybrid-A-Search
This project tests hybrid A* search alogrithm based on ackermann steering holonomic constraint.\  
The simulation was built on MATLAB.  Run hybrid_A_star to perform the test.\  
ackermann_sampler function was built to perform holonomic search sampling based on the lowest cost in open list.\  
collision_check function was implemented to check if the sampling point is in collision with obstacles.\
