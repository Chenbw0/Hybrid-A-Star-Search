# Global-Hybrid-A-Search
This project tests hybrid A* search alogrithm based on ackermann steering holonomic constraint.<br/>
1. The simulation was built on MATLAB.<br/>
2. Run hybrid_A_star.m to perform the test.<br/>
3. ackermann_sampler.m is the function built to perform holonomic search sampling based on the lowest cost in open list.<br/>
4. collision_check is the function implemented to check if the sampling point is in collision with obstacles.<br/>
